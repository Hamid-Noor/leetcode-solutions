# LeetCode Solutions: Circular Sentence Problem

This repository contains my solution to the **Circular Sentence** problem from LeetCode, implemented in Python. This problem focuses on string manipulation and algorithmic thinking, ideal for anyone looking to enhance their skills in solving coding challenges with Python.

## Problem Description
The **Circular Sentence** problem asks us to determine if a given sentence is circular. In other words, we need to check if the last character of each word matches the first character of the next word, and if the sentence wraps around back to the beginning.
